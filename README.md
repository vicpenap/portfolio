This a Play! web application intended to be a personal portfolio.

Currently shows this sections: 

- a twitter feed reader
- a lists of project summaries linking to their homepages
- a cv
- a flickr api reader
- a contact section

## Set up

Edit `conf/application.conf` and add your play secret key, flickr api key 
and admin area password. Search for $$$$ as placeholders for those.

To get a new play secret key, just type play secret in command line, inside
the project's folder.

To get a new flickr api key, you'll have to create a new flickr app: http://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/
